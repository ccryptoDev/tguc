        <h3>Additional notice to California residents</h3>
        <p>
          We are required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
          (“CCPA”) to provide to California residents an explanation of how we
          collect, use and share their personal Information, and of the rights
          and choices we offer California residents regarding our handling of
          their personal information.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="no-page-break">
        <p>
          Under the CCPA, this Notice to California residents and the privacy
          practices and rights it describes do not apply to the information we
          collect, use or disclose about individuals in connection with their
          application for or use of TGUC financial products and services. This
          information is subject to the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and
          implementing regulations or the California Financial Information
          Privacy Act.

          <b>California residents’ privacy rights. </b>
          The CCPA grants individuals whose information is governed by the CCPA
          the following rights:
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Information.</b>
            California residents can request information about how we have
            collected and used their personal information during the past 12
            months. We have made this information available to California
            residents without having to request it by including it in this
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Access. </b>
            California residents can request a copy of the personal information
            that we have collected about them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Deletion. </b>
            California residents can ask us to delete the personal information
            that we have collected from them.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Opt out of sale of personal information. </b>
            We do not sell personal information. Like many businesses, we use
            services that display interest-based ads to users around the web. We
            offer instructions on how to limit online tracking in the “Online
            tracking opt out” section above.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        California residents are entitled to exercise the rights described above
        free from discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that the CCPA limits these rights by, for example,
        prohibiting us from providing certain sensitive information in response
        to an access request and limiting the circumstances in which we must
        comply with a deletion request. If we deny a request, we will
        communicate our decision to the requester.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>How California residents can exercise their rights </b>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Identity verification. </b>
            We will need to confirm the identity of the requester and their
            California residency in order to process requests to exercise the
            above rights. We cannot process requests if we are not provided with
            sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.

            <b>Authorized agents. </b>
            California residents can empower an “authorized agent” to submit
            requests on their behalf. We will require the authorized agent to
            have a written authorization confirming that authority.
