    <h4>NOTICE TO COSIGNER</h4>
    <p>You are being asked to guarantee this debt. Think carefully before you do. If the borrower
doesnâ€™t pay the debt, you will have to. Be sure you can afford to pay if you have to, and that you
want to accept this responsibility.</p>
    <p>You may have to pay up to the full amount of the debt if the borrower does not pay. You may
also have to pay late fees or collection costs, which increase this amount. </p>
    <p>The creditor can collect this debt from you without first trying to collect from the borrower. The
creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower,
such as suing you, garnishing your wages, etc. If this debt is ever in default, that fact may
become a part of your credit record.</p>
    <p>This notice is not the contract that makes you liable for the debt.</p>
    <p class="text-center">* * * * *</p>
    <p>I have been given a completed copy of this notice and of the agreement that obligates the
borrower and cosigner on this debt.
