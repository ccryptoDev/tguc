                    titled in Dealer’s name and held by a U.S. financial

                    maintained in the Deposit Account, these debit transactions
                    might affect up to all funds held in the Deposit Account or
                    accessible through any overdraft or similar features offered
                    by Dealer’s financial institution. Dealer agrees that if a
                    debit transaction is rejected for any reason, TGUCF may
                    attempt to debit the Deposit Account again until the
                    transaction is completed, and that TGUCF is not responsible
                    for any fees charged by Dealer’s financial institution in
                    connection with this Agreement, including fees related to

                    Lender under this Agreement have been paid in full. This
