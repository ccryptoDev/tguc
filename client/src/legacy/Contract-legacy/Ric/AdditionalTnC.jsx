            If this Agreement is subject to a law which sets maximum interest
            rates and/or charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that
            the interest or other charges collected or to be collected in
            connection with this Agreement exceed such permitted limits, then:
            (a) we will reduce any such interest rate by the amount necessary to
            reduce the charge to the permitted limit; and (b) any sums already
            collected from you which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded
            to you. We may choose to make this refund by reducing the
            outstanding balance owed under the Agreement or by making a direct
            payment to you. Your acceptance of any such refund made by direct
            payment to you, whether by direct payment to you or by credit to
            your outstanding balance, will constitute a waiver of any right of
            action you may have arising out of such overcharge.

            pay under this Contract will increase to 35.90% per annum. In that
            event, we will notify you of your new payment schedule.

            are the subject of bankruptcy proceedings; or (c) you die, we at our
